Golden & Death Cross Stock Analysis

This project is a stock data analysis tool designed to detect and visualize Golden Cross and Death Cross patterns. The tool pulls stock data from the Alpha Vantage API and calculates both short-term and long-term simple moving averages (SMAs) to identify these important market signals.

Key Features

	•	Golden Cross Detection: Identifies when the short-term SMA (e.g., 50-day) crosses above the long-term SMA (e.g., 200-day), signaling a potential upward trend.
	•	Death Cross Detection: Detects when the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA, signaling a potential downward trend.
	•	Data Visualization: Plots the stock price alongside the short-term and long-term SMAs for easy visualization of crossovers.
	•	Customizable Parameters: Users can modify the time periods for the SMAs, as well as the stock ticker symbols and date ranges for analysis.
